            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p> Are you an experience skier or snowboarder? Are you just a beginner? Either way this website is for you. If you tried to buy new gear, theres a good chance you found it was just too expensive. If you've tried to buy used gear, you probably couldn't find out if the gear was right for you, or if it would even fit you. Every piece of gear sold here, used or unused, no matter how cheap, will have detailed speficiations so you know if its right for you. If you don't know whats rights for you our resources can help you find out With my website buying used gear doesn't have to be a shot in the dark.</p>
